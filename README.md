Experimenting with adding YoutTube support to WP Featherlight

# description

WP Featherlight is a lightweight lightbox plugin that will automatically convert media images in your article content to light-box ready images. This modified version enhances WP Featherlight to check if the media image is linking to a YouTube video, and replaces the image in the light box with an inframe embed of the YouTube video. 

In order to create this modification we have left the wpFeatherlight.js file unminified and uncombined with other JS dependencies which might be considered a small setback for some, but a remedy is available though 3rd party minification plugins. 

Feel free to fork this for personal use or create pull requests.
